TITLE OF  THE  PROPOSAL
Data on the rate of people living with cancer and introducing possible solution to end cancer.
Executive summary
        In this century, cancer is one of the significant general wellbeing concern worldwide and being the second most wellbeing perilous sickness, which has cause passings in the United states and in other piece of the world. In the general public 90% of canceroccurrence originates from natural causes (for example way of life, diet, contamination) and just 10% to causes outside our ability to control (i.e. genetics).
Regardless, restorative practice is prevalently receptive to cancer and numerous medicinal services endeavors are distributed to malignant growth the executives yet do not have the incorporation of counteractive action into generally wellbeing the executives. The absence of frameworks that can coordinate information to encourage infection anticipation is a significant hindrance in wellbeing the board. This issue is quickly developing in light of the fact that the measure of information(data), models, and biomarkers that help them is exponentially expanding. Information gathering of the board of malignant growth and wellbeing related information at each medical clinic in the United State will be done .cancer related information on cancer  patients and biospecimens, (for example, tumor examples, germ line DNA, serum, pee, and plasma) will be gathered from those people. constructed from machine learning and biometric data. Some concealed customary leaves that fix cancer will at that point be inspected and created as human restorative medications in both fluid and case and will be put to test utilizing littler creature as an example before being applied to human. An application will at that point be created which will teach individuals well on the nourishment and different things that causes cancer and when taken things to take to maintain a strategic distance from development which could prompt cancer. It will also include lates collected data on cancer and the reduction in cancer patientâ€™s daily will all be shared on both application and social media.
Key innovative concepts featured in this project: the individualized patient decision on the drugs, medicine, findable, accessible, reusable data 
The main objective of proposed research,(what is the exploration issue?) significance of the problem . (for what reason is the issue worth understanding?) 

There are a few key improvements in medicinal services and cancer growth care that have prompted the inception of this venture: 

1. Huge volumes of exceptionally useful information are gathered however not utilized for customized medication and patient strengthening. More information than any other time in recent memory is recorded in electronic medicinal records in clinics, and even on cell phones and handheld gadgets, than any time in recent memory. In any case, the vast lion's share of these information are not findable, available, and reusable (FAIR) for researchers to consolidate into their exploration. 

2. The undiscovered capability of utilizing forecast models for customized drug and patient strengthening. Prescient displaying for any (normal) condition is finished with expanding achievement. For instance, at present >100 such models have been approved for contrasting perspectives that depict prostate cancer for Utilizing these models related to make a customized hazard profile for most illnesses and conditions would be of extraordinary advantage to the client. Patients with web- intervened model-based development and routine observation experience expanded by and large survival.Be that as it may, this is presently not effectively accomplished for cancer growth care. 
3. Patients are given constrained power over their wellbeing. Various concentrates are accessible on the hazard factors for decreased personal satisfaction, misery and cancer  repeat. With the approach of customized medication, expectation models have been made that can foresee with exactness these personal satisfaction related measures for patients. Be that as it may, patients are deficiently mindful and are in this manner unfit to settle on wellbeing cognizant decisions and effectively deal with their wellbeing status.
4. Including patients in picking the best treatment. Mutual basic leadership (SDM) is the procedure of coordinated effort among patients and clinicians to assess all data pertinent to the patient's condition and arrive at the best treatment choice guided by the patient's inclinations and qualities. The patient advantages of SDM have been demonstrated with level 1 proof on more than 30.000 patients. To improve patients' QoL, human services quality, and diminish superfluous strategies, it is pivotal to engage patients with strong choice support. Regardless of the proof, quiet choice guides are not routinely applied in practice.
5. Production of drugs. Drugs that could put an end to cancer which could eliminate the use of surgery operation for cancer patients





Problems
Regardless of late progresses in cancer  growth treatment and the exponential increment in biomarkers and treatment choices, disease understanding treatment is a long way from ideal. Restricted use is made of the accessible expectation models, leaving cancer growth  care to be paternalistic and without tolerant inclusion. Huge volumes of information are gathered and left unleveraged because of restricted interoperability and accessibility. At long last, patients are inadequately educated how to take control regarding their wellbeing following treatment.There is not yet a permanent cure for Cancer.
The Research   plan (by what method will you address the issue?) 
I)  Informational on cancer and rate of cancer patient at each medical clinic in the United State will be gathered and treated before sharing it on application and social media.
ii). Gathered information will be use to develop an application and open social media for people accessibility
iii) Research will be carried out on how to put an end to cancer.
iii). Client explicit biomarker information is estimated on the fly utilizing financially accessible Simple and New application will be developed which can be access on less and cheaper machine to view the present state of progress and information gathered.
vi). Simple open application and data via web-based networking media will be accessible to the clinician, demonstrating a rundown of the prosperity of the patient. This will empower guardians to mediate and help the patient where required.
Vii).Drugs  will be availability for individual at accredited pharmaceutical stores  for consumer.


The advancement in the proposed research (what new strategy is being created) 

1. Customized prescription and patient association. Utilization of the application and our web based life empowers a functioning inclusion of the patient in his own restorative administration. 

2. Novel utilization of patient choice guides. There is proof level 1 (in excess of 100 randomized preliminaries) that choice guides improve normal learning of treatment alternatives and results. The improvement is clinically significant in light of the fact that the scores of individuals in the typical consideration gathering were lacking for educated basic leadership. Utilizing our application and internet based life , patients will have the option to settle on various choices. We are moving above and beyond so individual can obtain more information and know a greater amount of their wellbeing without being instructed by specialists. 

3. Web-intervened catch up with routine observation in lung cancer patients expands in general endurance in those patients. In this venture, we go one stage past this and guide patients previously, during and after treatment. 

4. Medications that will put a conclusion to cancer growth will be accessible for utilization. 

The foreseen outcomes alongside short and long haul benefits 

We envision that: 

1. Information from the emergency clinics can be joined with persistent information will be made accessible on application and internet based life 

2. Patients that utilization the our application and online life for shared basic leadership about treatment choices discover this guidance intelligible and are better educated about potential medications. This will improve their fulfillment about care. 

3. After treatment, patients can be enabled and propelled to assume responsibility for their very own wellbeing by methods for an advanced mentor that gives them direction. Interare vention studies show that movement and repeat of cancer  growths can be diminished by way of life changes. Along these lines, on the long haul it is normal that high-throughput utilization of the application and online networking will decreased the weight on our social insurance framework and improve the general wellbeing and future of the populace. 

4. We are to thought of a medications both in container and tonic that could put a conclusion to cancer growth
